# BookInventory
This application is designed to manage the inventory of books in the Library or Bookstore.

1. The "Backend.py" file contains the code for all the backends of this program. It uses "sqlite3" as a database to store data.
2. The "Frontend.py" file contains the code for the frontend of this program. It uses the "tkinter" library to build a GUI.
3. The "app.exe" is a complete and ready to use application.

It can be downloaded from the top (You only have to download .exe file as the code is just for reference) or using https://github.com/siddharthjain919/BookInventory/raw/main/app.exe and if you use it for the first time it will create a "books.db" database in that current folder which will contain all the data.
